# üé® Qwen-Image MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude Code to generate images locally using the state-of-the-art Qwen-Image model.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Local Generation**: Run entirely on your machine - no API keys or cloud services required
- **High-Quality Output**: Powered by Qwen-Image, a 20B parameter model with exceptional capabilities
- **Text Rendering**: Superior text rendering in images (especially for Chinese and English)
- **Multiple Styles**: Support for photorealistic, artistic, anime, and various other styles
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with CUDA support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Claude Code with MCP support
- 20GB free disk space for model download (first run only)
- Recommended: GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (works on CPU but slower)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qwen-image-mcp.git
cd qwen-image-mcp
```

2. **Run the installer:**
```bash
python install.py
```

This will:
- Install all required dependencies
- Register the server with Claude Code
- Provide usage instructions

### Manual Installation

If the automatic installer doesn't work:

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Register with Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user qwen-image python /path/to/server.py
```

3. **Restart Claude Code or run `/mcp` command**

## üí¨ Usage in Claude Code

Once installed, you can generate images by simply asking Claude:

```
"Generate an image of a majestic mountain landscape at sunset"
"Create a portrait of a happy golden retriever in a garden"
"Make an image with the text 'Welcome' in elegant typography"
```

### Parameters You Can Specify

- **Size**: "512x512", "768x768", "1024x1024", "portrait", "landscape"
- **Steps**: Number of generation steps (20-100, default 50)
- **Guidance**: CFG scale (1.0-10.0, default 4.0)
- **Seed**: For reproducible results

Example with parameters:
```
"Generate a 1024x1024 image of a tropical beach, 
use 60 steps and guidance 5.0"
```

## üéØ Model Capabilities

Qwen-Image excels at:

- **Text Rendering**: Accurately renders text in multiple languages
- **Photorealistic Images**: High-quality realistic imagery
- **Artistic Styles**: From oil paintings to anime aesthetics
- **Complex Compositions**: Multi-element scenes with proper relationships
- **Detail Preservation**: Maintains fine details even in complex scenes

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `HF_HOME`: Cache directory for model downloads (optional)
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: GPU selection for multi-GPU systems

### Output Directory

By default, images are saved to:
- macOS/Linux: `~/Pictures/qwen_images/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\qwen_images\`

## üìä System Requirements

### Minimum
- CPU: Any modern x86_64 or ARM64 processor
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 25GB free space

### Recommended
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM or Apple Silicon with 16GB+ unified memory
- RAM: 32GB
- Storage: 50GB free space (for model and generated images)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Server not connecting
```bash
# Check if server runs standalone
python server.py

# Re-register with Claude Code
claude mcp remove qwen-image
claude mcp add --scope user qwen-image python /path/to/server.py
```

### Out of memory errors
- Reduce image size (try 512x512 or 768x768)
- Close other applications
- Consider using CPU mode (slower but uses system RAM)

### Black/corrupted images
- Ensure model downloaded completely
- Check you have latest version of diffusers
- Try reinstalling: `pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers`

### First run is slow
The first generation downloads the 20GB model. Subsequent runs use the cached model.
