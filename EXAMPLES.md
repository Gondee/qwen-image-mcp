- "soft diffused light", "harsh directional light", "rim lighting"

### 3. Add Technical Details
- "8K resolution", "ultra detailed", "sharp focus"
- "shallow depth of field", "tilt-shift effect"

### 4. Specify Mood and Atmosphere
- "peaceful", "dramatic", "mysterious", "vibrant"
- "moody", "ethereal", "cinematic"

### 5. Use Composition Terms
- "rule of thirds", "centered composition", "symmetrical"

## ‚ùå What to Avoid

- **Overly complex prompts**: Keep it under 200 words
- **Contradictory descriptions**: "dark bright image" confuses the model
- **Too many style mixtures**: "oil painting watercolor anime style" gives inconsistent results
- **Impossible physics**: "water flowing upward naturally" may produce artifacts

Qwen-Image handles multiple languages well:

```
"Sign that says 'Welcome' in English, 'Ê¨¢Ëøé' in Chinese, and 'Bienvenido' 
in Spanish, modern design, clean typography"

## üîÑ Iterating on Results

If your first result isn't perfect:

1. **Adjust guidance**: Lower for more creative, higher for more literal
2. **Add more specific details**: Colors, textures, positioning
3. **Change style descriptors**: Try different artistic influences
4. **Modify composition**: Specify viewing angle, distance, framing
5. **Use a seed**: Set a seed number and make small prompt adjustments

Remember: The model needs to download (~20GB) on first use, but subsequent generations are much faster!
